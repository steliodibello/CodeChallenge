Architectural Design
- Azure WebRole
WCF Restful Service
HttpModule to validate ACS Tokens and get user Claims

-SQL Azure
Simple Booking Database created with codefirst and EF 4.31

-ACS with custom Service Identities and SWT tokens
to perform user authentication

-Console application to invoke the service
code is quite ugly, but it is just a demo how to consume the service...

-Entity Framework 
ConcurrencyCheck data annotation for avoididng collision if 2 users request seats at the same time...

Business Requirements
-PreBooking concept
To provide a better user experience for the customers & operators I have implemented a "PreBooking" status so that a client can complete
the booking without risking that somebody else take his tickets...
There is missing a component to cleanUp the reservations in standby after X minutes and keeping an history of the "lost elapsed preBook".


Security Considertations

Solution Design

Architectural Improvements
-deployment of the service over ssl
-asyncronus infrastructure for the Confirmation Booking Request to improve reliability under high load...
-Enabling Logging & Performance counters
-Enabling Azure autoscaling 
-Unit Test
-Integration test
-Comments and documentation

Interesting points
-ACS security model 
Soap listener / httpmodule / certificates
-Pessimistic lock on the dataEntities
